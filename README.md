Goals and Objectives:
The goal of this project is to classify a user's review as either good or negative. The user's review would be the input, and the intended result would be the mood (positive/negative).


Motivation:
Due to elements such as sarcasm, context, human error, and the use of emojis, sentiment analysis is one of the most difficult problems in natural language processing. Despite its difficulty, there are a plethora of open-source libraries and packages that include built-in sentiment analysis support, as well as vast, real-world datasets. Sentiment analysis is employed in a variety of sectors and applications, making it a great topic for project research.
 

Significance:
Sentiment analysis is frequently used by online retailers to rank client feedback and evaluate which features of a product are appreciated and which are not. This information can then be used by the corporation to correct specific product flaws while keeping what customers loved, resulting in higher overall customer happiness and retention. It would be preferable to have as accurate a classification model as feasible if sentiment analysis is applied in this process.


Objectives:
The goal will be accomplished in phases. Using a single model and tuning the hyperparameter while optimizing the accuracy would be the primary goal of the first stage.
The second/final stage is to compare different models using several models such as Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, and so on. We're thinking about using evaluation measures for this as well.
Features:
Data Used: The dataset "Amazon Reviews for Sentiment Analysis" on Kaggle is used.
Size: The Dataset contains roughly 3 million customer reviews, both positive (with a 4 to 5 star rating) and negative (with a 1 to 2 star rating) 
Preprocessing: The data has already been preprocessed into the format that FastText requires.
Preprocessed Data: The preprocessed data will be split into two sets: training and testing.
